Running the Animation

1. Open Processing (P3D Mode Required)

   - Ensure you have Processing installed on your computer.

   - Open Processing and set the mode to P3D.

2. Load the Project

   - Open the group_16_assignment5.pde file in Processing.

   - Ensure all associated .pde files (Legs.pde, Head_and_Torso.pde, etc.)    are in the same folder.

   - Ensure the data folder (containing cylinder.obj, cylinder.mtl, and texture.png) is present in the same directory.

3. Run the Animation

   - Click the Run button in Processing.

   - The animation will display a walking character in a 3D environment with a dynamically changing background.

4. Interaction and Notes

   - The sun moves in an arc, transitioning the background from day to night.

   - The legs animate to simulate walking.

   - The 3D ground should be visible, positioned correctly for perspective.

Troubleshooting

   - If the animation does not run, ensure P3D mode is enabled in Processing.

   - If the ground does not appear, check that the data folder contains the required cylinder.obj and texture.png files.

   - If performance issues occur, try reducing the number of clouds in the Background class initialization.
